</h1>

<p style="text-align: left"> Over The Decade's Minecraft is a well known game because of it's gameplay and how the game works however some fan's are still arguing and can't decide which version of it is better.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left"> Java Edition is made only for pc in order to play mods with friends you have to consider downloading the same mod use to be able to play with your friends however in Bedrock Edition you don't need that. </p>
<p style="text-align: left"> Another thing is you cannot join servers in Java if you are using any of your mobile devices because Java Edition is made for computer however in Bedrock you can play whatever platform you are using as long as you know the ip adress of the server. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">How many people play Minecraft? Since its release in 2011, Minecraft has amassed 141 million active players worldwide. The popular sandbox game, which is developed by Swedish game publisher, Mojang, allows players to build 3D worlds with different types of blocks and then explore and craft items within their new world. </p>
<p style="text-align: left"> Markus "Notch" Persson made his fortune selling the rights to his game Minecraft to Microsoft. In September 2014, after selling 15 million copies of Minecraft across gaming consoles, Persson sold out to Microsoft in a $2.5 billion cash deal. </p>
<p style="text-align: left"> Over all it's hard to decide because every people have a different perspective in life but if im given a chance to choose i will pick java because it has more features than bedrock but still both are best and enjoyable for me. </p>
